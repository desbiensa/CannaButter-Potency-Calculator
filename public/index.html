      content="New recipes with Cannabis (butter, powder, oil) and learning as we go about infusion and absorption. Since marijuana has been legalized in Canada i think it's time we enjoy all aspects of it. This channel is also dedicated to people who loves to get high and are maybe not fan of smoking. Edible making is much more than just getting stone, the buzz you get when THC and/or CBD is introduced to food is so different, and you get to balance things out in order to guide the people you serve food to on a calculated journey!"

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
